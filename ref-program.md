# Referral Program

Adspect has a referral program that allows our customers to earn money for bringing new clients to us.
The referral program works on a revenue share basis, that is, the referral fee is credited to your
balance each time a customer that you brought purchases a subscription.

**The referral fee is 10%.** However, it may be increased individually if you manage to bring new clients
consistently. Please contact us if you have considerable presence on affiliate marketing or SMM forums,
blogs, or in Telegram groups, and we will find a mutually profitable agreement.

The referral fee is credited to your account balance. Each time an invoice is created, funds on your
balance are used first and deducted from the total amount that remains to be paid. This means that if
you have enough funds on your balance, then you may use them to purchase a subscription wholly. For each
credited fee, you will receive a referral fee receipt in the Invoices section of the members area.

You may find your referral link in the Ref. Program section, along with a list of your referral clients.
Use that link to promote Adspect, and each new member registered by it will be accounted as your referral.
